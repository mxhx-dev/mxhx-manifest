# MXHX Manifest

Parses MXHX manifest files that map namespaced components to fully-qualified Haxe class names

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.0

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```sh
haxelib git mxhx-manifest https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-manifest.git
```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your Haxe _.hxml_ file.

```hxml
--library mxhx-manifest
```

For Lime and OpenFL, add it to your _project.xml_ file.

```xml
<haxelib name="mxhx-manifest" />
```
